    <h3>User-friendly interfaces are crucial for everyday campus services, yet the experience of students 
        using Brown University’s laundry machines often goes unexamined.</h3>
    <h4>This case study explores the personas of users interacting with the university’s laundry service interface. 
        Understanding these personas will help inform design recommendations for a more intuitive and accessible laundry experience at Brown.</h4>

    <h1 class="user-interviews">User Interviews</h1>
    <h2 class="no-background-blue">To gain deeper insights into the user experience with the laundry kiosk interface, I conducted interviews with users who regularly interact with the system.</h2>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Were there any moments of confusion or hesitation while using the interface? If so, can you describe them?</strong></td>
            <td>Most users found the interface intuitive, but some were confused by the inability to change washer and dryer settings from the kiosk.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>What features, if any, do you find particularly intuitive?</strong></td>
            <td>The clear machine selection process (with large, visible numbers) was praised. The payment system was also seen as quick and easy.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>If you could change one thing about the interface, what would it be?</strong></td>
            <td>The most requested feature was the ability to start washers from the kiosk instead of having to go back to the machines. Users also wanted washer settings to be adjustable from the kiosk.</td>

        of users of this interface.</h2>

<h1 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<h2 class="conclu">Brown's laundry kiosk interface falls short in terms of difficulty in selecting the correct machine, the inability to adjust settings from the kiosk, 
    and confusion when swiping ID cards. My findings suggest that allowing users to start machines from the interface and improving feedback for card swipes could significantly improve the experience.
